# Texturierung Projekt

## Note for developers
If you want to modify something in **shaders** (`fragment.glsl` and `vertex.glsl`), and assuming you are working with CLion IDE, follow these steps:
- do whatever adjustments you want
- `Tools` &#8594; `CMake` &#8594; `Reload CMake Project`

By running the project, `Build` is automatically executed
